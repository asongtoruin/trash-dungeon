The\nscattered huts of my kin were based in a small glade between mountain and\nwoodland. One cold winter day, Orcs came down from the mountain caves, in search\nfor meat. The absence of flesh in the mountain had made them outraged with\nhunger. Being a very good treeclimber, I hid in the branches of an old pine tree\nwhile every last of my kin was murdered and every hut set aflame.\nAfter making sure the Orcs had retired back into the mountain, I came down from\nthe tree and wandered the forest. An old hermit, a human, called Sillifrey,\nfound me while sourcing mushrooms in the woods. He had made for himself a small\nhut, well hidden whatever the season, between thick pines in the forest. Taking\npity on me, he took me in and thought me all he knew.\nSillifrey used to be a lone hunter, selling his meat to the Dwarves of the\nmountains, before they were all chased out of their halls by murderous Orcs. I\nhad never heard a word uttered on his kin or how he came to live in the forest\nby himself, and I did not ask for I did not want to seem impertinent as he had\ngenerously given me a home.\nHe educated me in the language of Dwarves, as well as the abundance that nature\ngives to us. Because of this he left me skilfull in sourcing food. I can track\nand hunt any woodland creature, and know my way well about the many berries and\nmushrooms that our forest gives us. I also know my way around many plants, and\nhow to craft them into a trusty medicine or a deadly poison. Outsiders were to\nbe avoided, so I was taught to be quiet while wandering, and to perceive my\nsurroundings in great stillness.\nThere was also time for leisure. He thought me to whistle a fine tune, as well\nas carving small woodland animals from branches. During my travels I still enjoy\nthese pasttimes near a roaring fire. And finally, he gifted me my common name,\nYllwalyn. The name gifted to me by my kin remains private, a token of an\nunspoken past.\nOne day my mentor got infected by a mysterious disease, which turned his skin\ninto black scabs and caused him great difficulty at breathing. On his deathbed\nhe instructed me to search for a community that I could call home, and to not\nshut myself off as he had done for so many years. The days he had left were\nshort, but painful. After his death, I buried him next to our cabin, along with\na small wooden goose. A symbol for prosperity in his afterlife.\nTaking his message to heart, I left my home. I have been travelling, and\nlooking for a place to feel at peace, ever since. Unfortunately my race makes\nit difficult to fit into any community, being neither accepted completely by\nElves nor humans. Nevertheless, I search for a band of likeminded people to\ncall my family.\n","description":"A half-elf ranger","id":7,"section":"characters","tags":["player-character"],"title":"Yllwalyn","uri":"http://trashdungeon.co.uk/characters/yllwalyn/"}]
