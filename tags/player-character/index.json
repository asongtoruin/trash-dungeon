Everything on the docks comes to a crashing halt and nobody else is moving except the 5 members of the party Loud voice - \u0026ldquo;I AM BAKTOS. I AM SEEKING THE GREATEST MEAL IN THE UNIVERSE. YOU FIVE HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO COOK ME\u0026hellip; A GOOD FUCKING MEAL\u0026rdquo; Sudden clap and disappear Lightly glowing reddish walls either side of us, and a pathway leading ahead At the end is a wooden door, slightly ajar, about 30 feet away The party heads through the door and is greeted by a huge room - 120 feet and circular Four doors going off it - two either side of the door we entered through, and two further around the perimeter Looks like a gladiatiorial coliseum, with a roof on it All around the area is tonnes of kitchenware - stoves, pots, basic spices etc. There are four distinct cooking areas - each one in a different quadrant - and a huge stage in the centre, 45 feet in diameter In the middle of the stage is a huge demon with ninja-style chef\u0026rsquo;s whites, and a santa hat, a huge mouth and very good horns He (Baktos) rises and says \u0026ldquo;I HAVE GATHERED YOU HERE AND I ASSUME YOU HAVE HEARD MY PREVIOUS DECREE. AS YOU SEE, I CAN STOP TIME AND PLACE AND BRING YOU TO ME. YOUR TASK, SHOULD YOU TAKE IT, IS TO COOK ME A REALLY GOOD FUCKING MEAL OR THREE\u0026rdquo; Baktos: \u0026ldquo;AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE ARE 4 OTHER DOORS YOU CAN GO THROUGH. YOU GET IT? GO THROUGH THERE, YOU MIGHT SEE PERIL, YOU MIGHT SEE OTHER ROOMS WITH OTHER INGREDIENTS, AND YOU GOT TO COOK ME THREE GOOD MEALS OTHERWISE YOU\u0026rsquo;LL BE THE DAMN MEAL. YOU GOT 20 HOURS TO DO THIS IN.\u0026rdquo; The group goes into the first door on the left, and ahead are three routes The group again goes left. Ahead is an ajar door with a light inside The room is around 30 feet wide, again circular, and contains a table, an anvil and a forge. On the anvil, a fork, spoon and knife are arguing about who is the best chef among them. Hellebore runs towards the centre of the room and reaches out to grab the utensils - they roll off the anvil Fork: \u0026ldquo;If you aren\u0026rsquo;t going to take us with you, maybe we can tell you about Baktos' weaknesses\u0026rdquo; Hellebore: \u0026ldquo;Why should we trust you?\u0026rdquo; Fork: \u0026ldquo;Well if you listen to us you won\u0026rsquo;t have to cook him a meal, you\u0026rsquo;ll only have to kill him\u0026rdquo; Ragnar detects some sense of trickery from two of the utensils, but not all three Fork: \u0026ldquo;To kill Baktos, you gotta force a mince pie down his throat so he chokes on it\u0026rdquo; Spoon: \u0026ldquo;No no no, you gotta wrap a whole wreath of tinsel around him\u0026rdquo; Knife: \u0026ldquo;No, you gotta sing Christmas carols and be truthful and festive around him\u0026rdquo; Yllwallyn asks the fork who we should listen to Fork, leaning up against the anvil: \u0026ldquo;You should trust me, why would I lie to a big person who could squash me\u0026rdquo; Yllwallyn can tell the fork is lying Yllwallyn: \u0026ldquo;Beautiful spoon, are telling the truth?\u0026rdquo; Spoon: \u0026ldquo;Of course I\u0026rsquo;m telling the truth!\u0026rdquo; Yllwallyn hears that the spoon is lying - so the knife is telling the truth Ragnar nodes at Percivous, the two each pick up one of the deceitful cutlery and cast them into the forge Yllwallyn: \u0026ldquo;Knife, which way should we go?\u0026rdquo; Knife: \u0026ldquo;Ahead is the Eldritch forge, left is the recipe library\u0026rdquo; The group head out into a hallway, there\u0026rsquo;s a battle between four rabbit-riding carrot knights and 8 porcini goblins, the latter are losing and carrying a tarasque sausage. A carrot knight falls to the porcini goblins, but the carrots slay 3 goblins. Percivous charges forward and swings his axe, killing two mushrooms. Yllwallyn runs in towards the carrots and swings her sword at two of the rabit-riders and manages to slice both them and their steeds into ribbons Hellebore dives forwards and grabs the remaining carrot-rider along with its steed Fain sees this and follows suit, grabbing a mushroom. Ragnar swings his hammer and pulverises the two remaining mushrooms. Hellebore asks the carrot what they were fighting about Carrot: \u0026ldquo;LEAVE US. WE\u0026rsquo;RE FIGHTING OVER WHO IS THE BETTER ADDITIONAL INGREDIENT TO A DISH\u0026rdquo; Hellebore: \u0026ldquo;How did you tame the rabbits?\u0026rdquo; Carrot: \u0026ldquo;We got our feet tendrils into their brains, it\u0026rsquo;s like Avatar\u0026rdquo; Hellebore: \u0026ldquo;Maybe we should let them fight to see who should go into our meal\u0026rdquo; The porcini manages to defeat the carrot-knight, but the rabbit then simply\u0026hellip; eats the mushroom. The rabbit stands victorious, the sausage rolls across the floor A tarasque is a gargantuan monstrosity - huge, bipedal dragon-dinosaurs, almost like a T-rex but with functional arms, found only in deserts or burning hot places The sausage is said to transform into a full-sized tarasque when it encounters gastric juices. Baktos' booming voice echoes through the dungeon: \u0026ldquo;AH, YOU FOUND ONE OF THOSE SAUSAGES. YOU SHOULD KNOW, I\u0026rsquo;M IMMUNE TO THAT. BUT I DO LOVE A SAUSAGE\u0026rdquo; Entering the library - it has a 60ft diameter, the walls lined with crumbling crimson papyrus scrolls. Branches hang from the ceiling containing ghost peppers. They are translucent and ungodly-spicy, containing long-dead souls of Christmas past. There are also 12 flying slug-moths, getting drawn to the flames lighting the room up (they don\u0026rsquo;t seem very edible) Baktos: \u0026ldquo;BE CAREFUL - IF YOU GET TOO CLOSE TO THE FIRE, THOSE SLUG-MOTHS GOT A BURN ON THEM\u0026rdquo; Fain starts looking at the scrolls, and notices a pattern. There seems to be some with vegetables and non-meat recipes, and then finally finds one for tarasque sausage casserole As he pulls it from the wall, another falls from the wall. It says \u0026ldquo;flesh to pie\u0026rdquo;. It provides a spell to transform humanoid-creatures into pie! Delicious. Hellebore grabs the torch from the sconce and pulls it away from the wall. The moths follow along, so Ragnar walks across and grabs five peppers. Percivous heads towards the dessert section with Yllwallyn The two adventurers find mince pie and yule log recipes within the Christmas section, how fortunate. The team head into the next room, between the two routes at the end of the corridor there is an insane scantily-clad chef who offers a selection of ingredients in exchange for a sacrifice of hours. The group agrees to sacrific three hours to the chef for one of a selection of special ingredients The group chooses to take the baked sun. Heading down one of the corridors, the group enteres another 30-foot room In the middle, there is a throne with a sleeping lich-chef holding half a baked sun. He\u0026rsquo;s surrounded by meat pies and mince pies Fain sneaks into the room and carefully steals 12 of the mince pies, shutting the door behind him. The group head past the scantily-clad chef and head round the corner of the corridor. At the end of this corridor there is another door. Halfway along there is a potato-knight cleansing a group of four porcini goblins with fire The group gang up on the potato (Ragnar misses) and take him down with aplomb He drops a leaf sword - Hellebore picks it up as the group pass the scene of the fight to enter another room In the next room - huge, as large as the starting arena - there is the crumbling remains of a giant skeleton. Dripping from its eye-sockets is moon water, and at its base there are moon-frogs fighting over the water. The group run through the room and exit swiftly, avoiding the frogs. This leads into a corridor - the group run through, past a blue crab wearing a coral-crusted cowboy hat on the ceiling, into a room containing a pirate ship surrounded by broken glass and containing lots of treasure. The group starts to look through the treasure - finding 6000 silver pieces and a glowing red stone. Underneath, there is a chalk-like substance. Percivous licks the stone, it tastes like a mixture of soap and chalk. His tongue glows a faint red. Passing into the next corridor, the blue crab begins to chase the group. Baktos: \u0026ldquo;THAT\u0026rsquo;S TWELVE TURNS GUYS. LOOKS LIKE YOU\u0026rsquo;VE GOT SOME TROUBLE THERE\u0026rdquo; As Ragnar and the crab face off, Ragnar swings his hammer over his head and crushes the body of the crab. In the next room, many broken shells surround a small castle-sized sleeping chicken (!!!!!!). Seven porcini-goblins are caring for the bird. Ragnar: \u0026ldquo;You might not be chestnuts but I\u0026rsquo;ll roast you like some, if you don\u0026rsquo;t let us have some eggs\u0026rdquo; (and shows them the previously-slain mushrooms) The porcini: \u0026ldquo;You can take whatever you want. She\u0026rsquo;s ready to lay, but her screams will burst your eardrums\u0026rdquo; The group head into the next room to avoid the shriek, and hear it off in the distance. Nipping back into the room, Ragnar retrieves the cosmic egg. The door leads back into the skeleton room, so the group exit through the only door in that room not passed through yet. At the end of the next corridor is a wine cellar containing 55 kegs of wine and a malt cask, protected by 7 cinnamon skeletons in golden armour. The group attack the skeletons (Ragnar misses) and kills 6 of them The remaining skeleton manages to land a hit on Percivous, before Ragnar crushes it with his hammer. The group start to open the kegs - as Percivous opens the keg he instead finds the cat-god of wines, who is hungry and meowing. He\u0026rsquo;s wearing a fancy jacket. Percivous gives him a piece of the squashed crab meat, and starts to follow him. Percivous calls the cat Glen. Hellebore takes a small container of the les hommes au vin, and the rest of the group grab some wine The group shout to Baktos that they have obtained all of their ingredients, and suddenly are returned to the main kitchen arena. The group begin to prepare the food for Baktos:  Ragnar cracks open the claws with his hammer, and Yllwallyn makes a garlic aioli Fain and Hellebore start to create the casserole with the various vegetables, sausage, rabbit and a small quantity of wine. Percivous uses the rolling pin from his equpment to prepare some pastry, and uses the mincemeat to create mince pies. Some of the wine and cinnamon are mixed together to make mulled wine.   Baktos' area transforms into a Masterchef judging panel. \u0026ldquo;YOU\u0026rsquo;RE BEING MARKED ON CREATIVITY, SERVICE AND MY OWN PREFERENCE\u0026rdquo; Ragnar presents the crab claws. One claw either side, with a small dish of aioli in the middle. The cowboy hat is used as a lid for the sauce. \u0026ldquo;THIS CRAB. I\u0026rsquo;M GIVING YOU A THREE FOR YOUR CREATIVITY. SERVICE? I\u0026rsquo;LL GIVE YOU A TEN. FLAVOUR? THAT\u0026rsquo;S AN EIGHT\u0026rdquo; Hellebore presents the casserole - featuring all of the ingredients and that bastard potato \u0026ldquo;CREATIVITY GETS A SIX. SERVICE? THAT GETS A FOUR. NOT ENOUGH SWEARING. BUT THE FLAVOUR? THAT\u0026rsquo;S A 10\u0026rdquo; Hellebore presents the mince pie and mulled wine, with much more swearing \u0026ldquo;CREATIVITY - TEN! I AIN\u0026rsquo;T NEVER HAD CHRISTMAS FOOD BEFORE. SERVICE, TEN. THAT\u0026rsquo;S MUCH MORE LIKE IT. FLAVOUR? I\u0026rsquo;LL GIVE THAT AN EIGHT.\u0026rdquo; Percy recevives a large butter knife from Baktos as the creator of the finest dish. \u0026ldquo;IT DOESN\u0026rsquo;T LOOK LIKE MUCH BUT\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; He turns around and the knife slices directly through the table \u0026ldquo;WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, YOU\u0026rsquo;VE FINISHED\u0026rdquo; As the room starts to fade away the group start to sing a Christmas carol and Baktos begins to melt away as the group return to the docks. No time seems to have passed, but there is a large chef-santa hat in the middle of the group\u0026hellip;  ","description":"IT'S THE CHRISTMAS SPECIAL!","id":1,"section":"sessions","tags":null,"title":"Session 4","uri":"http://trashdungeon.co.uk/sessions/session-4/"},{"content":" The group are in Volkas' office. Door swings open, and the server says the shipment has arrived, and there aren\u0026rsquo;t enough people to bring the shipment back to the tavern. Percivous throws his chair back, storms off through the door: \u0026ldquo;I need to sort something out. I won\u0026rsquo;t be long\u0026rdquo; Volkas has a heated discussion with the member of staff. Lots of the tavern\u0026rsquo;s staff have taken the opportunity to leave. Volkas: \u0026ldquo;Listen. You need to talk to Gryf, and I need help getting this shipment to the bar. You\u0026rsquo;ll be doing the city and me a great favour\u0026rdquo; Hellebore: \u0026ldquo;Can I have a bottle of whiskey to take with me?\u0026rdquo; Volkas: \u0026ldquo;Gnome, you can have five bottles of whiskey once the shipment is back\u0026rdquo; Outside the tavern, it\u0026rsquo;s still fairly busy in the marketplace Fain, with his city knowledge, knows going through the marketplace isn\u0026rsquo;t the fastest walk. He waves between the stores, through back alleys and around vendors, to lead the docks. Pass by a ward garrison within the keep - the town guard\u0026rsquo;s training area is here Can see the jail as we walk past, carefully. Arrive at an open market. Different atmosphere to the main market - lots of wooden tables with covers, everything possible for sale - meats, furs, other things. Huge bridge visible across the river. As the bridge is passed, the ground changes from stone to wood. We have reached the docks. As the party walks onto the docks, we can see a poorly-maintained area. Some of the wood is split and rotting, there are piles of boxes and a crowd of sailors and merchants. It is a distinctly unimpressive scene. Greeted by a hauty-looking elven man - dressed very lavishly, and wearing lots of jewellery in contrast to the surroundings The elf: \u0026ldquo;Yes? Can I help you?\u0026rdquo; Fain: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re here to help to carry the shipment back to the Red Dragon pub\u0026rdquo; The elf: \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s my job as the dock owner to let you in but\u0026hellip; we\u0026rsquo;re just so busy, we don\u0026rsquo;t have the room\u0026rdquo; He turns to walk away Hellebore: \u0026ldquo;Oi elf. You\u0026rsquo;re going to let us in or else\u0026rdquo; The elf stops, and looks back at the party over his shoulder with a very intimidating glance. \u0026ldquo;I suggest you move away from the docks, before trouble will find you\u0026rdquo; He raises his hand, and two orcs start to head across Ragnar: \u0026ldquo;You think trouble will come to us. I think the trouble will come to you\u0026rdquo; His hand falls,a nd he returns to the party. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t deal with words normally. I deal with\u0026hellip; money. But seeing as you\u0026rsquo;re so determined to come in, go about your business\u0026rdquo; Heading over to the docks, there are three huge boats - galleons, decked out with cannons - and two medium-sized boats. The sailors at the docks look fairly rough, as do the docks themselves. It\u0026rsquo;s clear no money has been spent on the docks in a long time. The two orcs that had been drawn towards the party aren\u0026rsquo;t the only ones visible to the group - various other orcs are dotted throughout the crowd. Yllwallyn shouts back after the elf: \u0026ldquo;Do you perhaps know Gryf Surefoot, kind sir?\u0026rdquo; The elf: \u0026ldquo;Gryf\u0026hellip; Surefoot? No, he\u0026rsquo;s not arrived yet. But for a fee we could tell you when\u0026rdquo; While this happens, a medium-to-large boat pulls towards land There seems to be lot of activity around the boat, and a ramp lowers A dragonborn sailor starts walking down the ramp with other sailors, carrying boxes The elf: \u0026ldquo;Ahh. Looks like your luck is continuing. Gryf is\u0026hellip; here.\u0026rdquo; Yllwallyn walks over to talk to Gryf and tries to introduce herself to him The elf steps between the party and Gryf, and demands money from Gryf Gryf looks annoyed, but hands the elf a bag of coins Gryf: \u0026ldquo;What can I do you for?\u0026rdquo; Yllwallyn: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve found a book with your name in it\u0026rdquo; Gryf: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m quite the sailor, there are many books with my name in it\u0026rdquo; Hellebore: \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s written in bloooood.\u0026rdquo; Fain: \u0026ldquo;Look, I have the book here. But, we can help you with this shipment and talk to you about it later\u0026rdquo; Gryf: \u0026ldquo;No, that\u0026rsquo;s fine. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry about the hassle from Hasalnae - come onboard and we can talk about it there.\u0026rdquo; Gryf points towards his captain\u0026rsquo;s quarters, telling the group to come inside. Gryf: \u0026ldquo;Look. Show me the book first, I need to trust you before I let you below deck. Who sent you here?\u0026rdquo; Yllwallyn, coughing: \u0026ldquo;I have something in my throat. Do you have any beer?\u0026rdquo; Gryf hands her a green bottle from under his desk Yllwallyn drinks from it, and feels an increasing burning sensation in her throat. Gryf: \u0026ldquo;Are you after an autograph or something, or do I have the wrong end of the stick?\u0026rdquo; Fain: \u0026ldquo;The wrong end of the stick.\u0026rdquo; Gryf: \u0026ldquo;Are you mocking me?\u0026rdquo; Fain: \u0026ldquo;Yes.\u0026rdquo; Gryf: \u0026ldquo;Fair enough. Where\u0026rsquo;s my name then?\u0026rdquo; Fain holds up the book for Gryf to see his name. Then he reaches out and closes the book Gryf: \u0026ldquo;This is not the place to discuss this. Have you spoken to any of the others in the book?\u0026rdquo; The group confirms. Gryf: \u0026ldquo;Look. I\u0026rsquo;ll come with you to the tavern, and we can discuss this with them there\u0026rdquo; Hasalnae comes in: \u0026ldquo;Look, how long are you going to be here. You haven\u0026rsquo;t given me nearly enough money to stay here for long\u0026rdquo; Gryf walks over, grabs his collar and pushes him out of the door Hasalnae: \u0026ldquo;What is the meaning of this?? These are my docks! You\u0026rsquo;ll pay or you\u0026rsquo;ll go!!\u0026rdquo; Gryf: \u0026ldquo;This may be your dock but it\u0026rsquo;s my ship. Fuck off\u0026rdquo; Gryf heads towards the ramp down from the ship. As he heads down, Hasselnae seems to be picking himself up and several orcs are heading over Gry turns to the group and says \u0026ldquo;Truth be told, it\u0026rsquo;s been a while since I\u0026rsquo;ve been back here. Something changed with Hasselnae a while back, and since then everything has been different\u0026rdquo; Fain: \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s different?\u0026rdquo; Gryf: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sure you saw the state of the dock, and the people around you - they\u0026rsquo;re miserable. They used to be full of life and full of cheer. And Hasalnae - he used to be so proud of it.\u0026rdquo; Ragnar: \u0026ldquo;Who is Hasalnae to you?\u0026rdquo; Gryf: \u0026ldquo;He used to be a friend. Being a sailor, you get to know a lot of the dock owners. Hasselnae, I\u0026rsquo;m just not sure what happened to him\u0026rdquo; Fain, muttering: \u0026ldquo;Is this even Haselnae?\u0026rdquo; Fain, to Gryf: \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;do you think it\u0026rsquo;s even still him?\u0026rdquo; Gryf, looking puzzled: \u0026ldquo;Truth be told, I\u0026rsquo;ve been wrapped up so much in my own thoughts that I\u0026rsquo;d neevr considered it\u0026rdquo; Fain: \u0026ldquo;Things don\u0026rsquo;t add up here. If he cared so much about the docks, why would he be spending so much money on himself\u0026rdquo; Yllwallyn: \u0026ldquo;What if he\u0026rsquo;s posessed by a demon?\u0026rdquo; Ragnar: \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s find out\u0026rdquo; and casts Divine Sense. There seems to be something foul at the bottom of the ramp, pulsing off Hasalnae, and a fiendish presence from where the elf is. Ragnar: \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t say that there\u0026rsquo;s a demon, but there\u0026rsquo;s definitely something afoot there\u0026rdquo; Yllwallyn: \u0026ldquo;I thought so\u0026rdquo; Hellebore: \u0026ldquo;That doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound good, does it.\u0026rdquo; Fain: \u0026ldquo;Shit. Looks like we should probably prepare for a fight.\u0026rdquo; Hellebore: \u0026ldquo;Gryf, are you going to help us?\u0026rdquo; Hasalnae steps onto the ramp Gryf: \u0026ldquo;Why would I fight Hasalnae?\u0026rdquo; Ragnar: \u0026ldquo;Gryf, that isn\u0026rsquo;t Hasalnae\u0026rdquo; Hellebore: \u0026ldquo;That hasn\u0026rsquo;t been Hasalnae for a loooong time\u0026rdquo; Gryf: \u0026ldquo;Listen. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to get involved in something that might threaten someone\u0026rsquo;s life, particularly someone that looks like someone I used to know. I won\u0026rsquo;t get in your way, but I\u0026rsquo;m here in case.\u0026rdquo; Hasalnae takes a second step onto the ramp Hasalnae: \u0026ldquo;The time for talking is over! You have threatened me on my land, you will pay\u0026rdquo; Fain readies his bow and fires an warning arrow near to Hasalnae Hellebore: \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s not going to stop coming\u0026rdquo; Fain fires an arrow at Hasalnae\u0026rsquo;s knee Ragnar starts to walk towards Hasalnae and shouts: \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s going on with you, but there\u0026rsquo;s some kind of evil here\u0026rdquo; Hellebore: \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not going alone\u0026rdquo; Hellebore starts to run towards Hasalnae Ragnar sighs, and starts to run alongside Hellebore Yllwallyn runs past the two of them Fain notices that the arrow has gone deeper into Hasalnae than would be expected, and that something looks amiss with the form Fain: \u0026ldquo;Be careful - it might be smaller than it looks\u0026rdquo; Fain fires another arrow, and the elf form dissipates and instead there\u0026rsquo;s a tiefling where the elf once stood She turns away, blinks and is suddenly four feet away from the bottom of the ramp, running away from the group. Fain rapidly fires another arrow after her, and hits. She continues running, and the group chases after her. Hellebore reaches forward to try and knock the tiefling over with his staff. She stumbles, and as she does Ragnar reaches forwards and grabs the tiefling\u0026rsquo;s cloak to throw her upwards and back towards the group. As she flies over them, Yllwallyn and Hellebore stretch up with their weapons and strike the tiefling as she passes She lands near to Fain\u0026rsquo;s feet Hellebore: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t kill her - maybe she can tell us something\u0026rdquo; Fain tries to strike the tiefling as she landas, but the wood beneath her buckles and the impact of the strike is lost As the tiefling rises to her feet, she disappears from view. There\u0026rsquo;s a disturbance in the crowd to ther right of the ramp, around ten feet away Ragnar: \u0026ldquo;GET OUT OF THE WAY\u0026rdquo; As the crowd parts due to the commotion, the tielfing is visible in the centre. The group runs to surround her Fain and Hellebore strike the tiefling and she crumples to the floor, knocked out.

Norah: \u0026ldquo;Well, I don\u0026rsquo;t mind getting behind the forge but it will cost a little bit more. I\u0026rsquo;m not the type to deal with\u0026hellip; standard weapons such as this.

The half-orc\u0026rsquo;s shoulders shake as she laughs. Percivous: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m new to this area. What\u0026rsquo;s the safety of this town like, is it a well-kept town? Do people bother you?\u0026rdquo; Norah: \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;d be hard-pressed to find trouble at a shop full of weapons! There is trouble in every city, particularly in the southern district and somewhat in the east here. It\u0026rsquo;s a city with a lot of issues, but unless you\u0026rsquo;re wearing gold you won\u0026rsquo;t find much out and out danger\u0026rdquo; Yllwalyn: \u0026ldquo;And what about the school of arcane?\u0026rdquo; Norah: \u0026ldquo;Its presence in the capital gives it a lot of prestige, as does the sheer scale of the school.

Is there anything I should keep an eye out for?\u0026rdquo; Norah: \u0026ldquo;People of this city are used to seeing a particular kind of uniform, and it\u0026rsquo;s been a while since anyone from Rost has been to the city. They\u0026rsquo;re probably more confused by your insignia rather than your race. The elite of the town keep to themselves, the barracks are designed to keep the city segregated. This area doesn\u0026rsquo;t see too much attention from the elite or the guard, but if you go south of the river you\u0026rsquo;ll see a lot more of that kind of presence.\u0026rdquo; Percivous: \u0026ldquo;Look, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen your name on a list in a weird book and I think you might be in danger.\u0026rdquo; Norah stops hammering. She puts her hammer down, as the weapons are finished, leaves them on the table and turns to walk away. The two follow her, picking up their weapons on the way. As she approaches a small building, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like a blacksmith\u0026rsquo;s (there\u0026rsquo;s no chimney), she invites the two to enter the building with her. Norah, slamming her hand on the desk: \u0026ldquo;What book.\u0026rdquo; Percivous: \u0026ldquo;Some travellers I met had it, they opened the book and it had your name in it in red ink\u0026rdquo; Norah sits back in her chair: \u0026ldquo;What are the other names?\u0026rdquo; They tell her about Volkas. Norah: \u0026ldquo;Was Gryf in the book?\u0026rdquo; They tell her he was Norah: \u0026ldquo;We used to be in a band of mercenaries, separate from the armies and cities. We fought against evil not for it. Although our adventuring days are over now, we offer what we can to the poor through charity. Let me ask you this - was the book in your posession before you went to the pub?\u0026rdquo; Yllwalyn: \u0026ldquo;No\u0026rdquo; Norah: \u0026ldquo;Do you remember how you got it?\u0026rdquo; Yllwalyn: \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;no\u0026rdquo; Norah: \u0026ldquo;Many years ago, we came up against something we couldn\u0026rsquo;t beat. It\u0026rsquo;s not an easy task to undertake. If I was you, I would leave this book and try to erase it from your memories. Get on with your lives, move away, don\u0026rsquo;t touch it. Are your names in the book?\u0026rdquo; Yllwalyn: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve only seen the first page\u0026rdquo; Norah: \u0026ldquo;We had two other members of our party who are no longer with us. Gryf is the only one of us who still adventures, he doesn\u0026rsquo;t come to the city much. Truth be told, I don\u0026rsquo;t speak to Volkas very much. This changed us. Gryf is scarred by memories, sometimes he brings goods to the city but he never delivers them himself. The person who would know most is Volkas.\u0026rdquo; The two leave. On the way back, Yllwalyn explains to Percivous that she is uncomfortable around orcs because they killed her family.  Meanwhile, in the pub\u0026hellip;  Fain: \u0026ldquo;Why is this gnomne not in the book?\u0026rdquo; Ragnar slams his hammer on the table Hellebore: \u0026ldquo;Dwarf\u0026hellip; I know as much as you about this damn book\u0026rdquo; Ragnar: \u0026ldquo;Who is Aethelwulf Broadoak?\u0026rdquo; Hellebore decides to shout the name across the bar. Nobody turns around. Hellebore: \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t you like me, dwarf?\u0026rdquo; Fain: \u0026ldquo;Maybe he just don\u0026rsquo;t like you, and that\u0026rsquo;s alright\u0026rdquo; Fain turns the further pages in the book, but there\u0026rsquo;s nothing else there. The only pages with writing on are the first two. Ragnar goes to the bar to get a beer Volkas: \u0026ldquo;We have no beer. We were meant to get a new shipment, but our supplier is\u0026hellip; inconsistent. Would you likw a whiskey instead\u0026rdquo; As Ragnar returns to the table, Percivous and Yllwalyn return to the pub  Everyone is back together again  Fain: \u0026ldquo;Before you tell us what you have learned, I have something to show you\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Fain shows them the book. Hellebore laughs and puts his feet on the table The moment his feet touch the table, a flustered-looking server comes and bats them off. Yllwalyn: \u0026ldquo;Why is my name in this book?\u0026rdquo; Fain: \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t we wait until closing time and try to speak to Volkas?\u0026rdquo; Volkas is standing on the central stage and he announces that the pub needs to close due to a lack of drink. People get up and start to leave. Fain: \u0026ldquo;That was lucky. Didn\u0026rsquo;t have to get the gnome to fart\u0026rdquo; As Volkas walks past the table, Ragnar sticks his hammer out to block his path Volkas: \u0026ldquo;Can I help? Or can you get out\u0026rdquo; Percivous, standing up: \u0026ldquo;I think you should take a seat, mate\u0026rdquo; Volkas' brow furrows, and he pulls a stool over to the table Percivous explains their trip to see Norah, as Fain pushes the book across the table Volkas stands up, walks to a door behind the bar and invites the group to enter Volkas: \u0026ldquo;Sit\u0026rdquo; The group sits at a table with him Volkas, in a commanding voice: \u0026ldquo;Put that book away. How did you come across this?\u0026rdquo; Fain: \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know. We came into this pub separately, something happened and then I had this book\u0026rdquo; Volkas: \u0026ldquo;Give me the book\u0026rdquo; Fain: \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do that, some new names have appeared in it\u0026rdquo; Volkas slams his hammer into the desk, cracking it: \u0026ldquo;Give me the book\u0026rdquo; Fain obliges Volkas opens the book, looks through it, and then says \u0026ldquo;You need to leave this\u0026rdquo; Percivous: \u0026ldquo;My name is in it, I can\u0026rsquo;t just leave it\u0026rdquo; Volkas sighs: \u0026ldquo;I take it all of your names are in the book?\u0026rdquo; Everyone looks at Hellebore, and he understands Volkas adds some detail to Norah\u0026rsquo;s story, noting that their two companions who died were at 6 and 7 in the list. There was a 6th companion in their team, but his name was also not in the book. He stepped back from fighting the evil they faced, he didn\u0026rsquo;t enter the room. Fain: \u0026ldquo;What does this mean for us. Are we\u0026hellip; marked?\u0026rdquo; Volkas: \u0026ldquo;The last time I saw this book was many years ago, and Zormanos' name was already in it. To see our two companions not present but Gryf and Norah still in the list and alive\u0026hellip; But you\u0026rsquo;re telling me you don\u0026rsquo;t know how you got in there? I remember the day we obtained the book. I can tell you that we did not win on that day, and that we chose to retreat after losing two people dear and close to us. I can also tell you that we fought our hardest, we all did as much as we could. The only person in the party who wasn\u0026rsquo;t into the book never entered the room. Maybe, were Gryf here, he could help with the\u0026hellip; memories. In fact, Gryf is the person were waiting on for the beer.\u0026rdquo; Fain: \u0026ldquo;So Gryf is missing?\u0026rdquo; Volkas: \u0026ldquo;Time doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for Gryf as it does for other people - as a sailor, he operates on his own time. He remaind somewhat aloof, and the only reason I keep him as a supplier is our shared history.\u0026rdquo; There is a knock on the door. One of the servers at the bar enters and says   The shipment has arrived\n ","description":"Remember pubs? Remember being in pubs?

Looks like bones at the base, and a cauldron that looks flaming-ish.

Yllwalyn heads towards the centre of the room to investigate. The light on the opposite wall goes out. Something is moving in the bones! It\u0026rsquo;s a winged tailed bone devil! Hasn\u0026rsquo;t noticed her yet. Hellebore and Ragnar stop fighting on seeing this - we\u0026rsquo;ll settle this later! - and ready their weapons Fain tries to sneak around the edge of the room into the darkened area, but the bone demon notices him He dives in and punches it, but the form fades away and only a skeletal beetle-like being remains. He punches again, bending over to strike the creature but again the form fades away and instead a humanoid skeletal form remains Hellebore runs in and tries to kick the creature, but his aim is bad and he misses Yllwalyn\u0026rsquo;s sword cuts straight through the humanoid form - it feels as though contact is made but the form changes again. All that remains is a human, clad in dark embroidered robes but that seem splattered with blood Ragnar runs over and goes to hit the human with his hammer - it hits with a thud but rather than a caved chest the human\u0026rsquo;s hand is blocking the strike, a few inches away from the hammer The party is thrown backwards - Yllwalyn and Hellebore are pushed to the floor, Fain and Ragnar keep their feet The human reaches up to the book on the lectern Fain grabs at the robe but loses traction. Ragnar grabs at the human\u0026rsquo;s belt, but as the hammer falls from his grip it falls and strikes him in the crotch. He loses his grip on the belt as he recoils in pain. Fain uses this opportunity to leap above the human, to and over the lectern and grabs the book as he passes. As he turns and lands the other side of the lectern, the being disappears from the room. The book snaps shut and the other lights begin to fade out. Where there should be a keyhole to open the clasp on the book, Fain instead finds\u0026hellip; nothing.

The scattered huts of my kin were based in a small glade between mountain and woodland. One cold winter day, Orcs came down from the mountain caves, in search for meat. The absence of flesh in the mountain had made them outraged with hunger. Being a very good treeclimber, I hid in the branches of an old pine tree while every last of my kin was murdered and every hut set aflame.\nAfter making sure the Orcs had retired back into the mountain, I came down from the tree and wandered the forest. An old hermit, a human, called Sillifrey, found me while sourcing mushrooms in the woods. He had made for himself a small hut, well hidden whatever the season, between thick pines in the forest. Taking pity on me, he took me in and thought me all he knew.\nSillifrey used to be a lone hunter, selling his meat to the Dwarves of the mountains, before they were all chased out of their halls by murderous Orcs. I had never heard a word uttered on his kin or how he came to live in the forest by himself, and I did not ask for I did not want to seem impertinent as he had generously given me a home.\nHe educated me in the language of Dwarves, as well as the abundance that nature gives to us. Because of this he left me skilfull in sourcing food. I can track and hunt any woodland creature, and know my way well about the many berries and mushrooms that our forest gives us. I also know my way around many plants, and how to craft them into a trusty medicine or a deadly poison. Outsiders were to be avoided, so I was taught to be quiet while wandering, and to perceive my surroundings in great stillness.\nThere was also time for leisure. He thought me to whistle a fine tune, as well as carving small woodland animals from branches. During my travels I still enjoy these pasttimes near a roaring fire. And finally, he gifted me my common name, Yllwalyn. The name gifted to me by my kin remains private, a token of an unspoken past.\nOne day my mentor got infected by a mysterious disease, which turned his skin into black scabs and caused him great difficulty at breathing. On his deathbed he instructed me to search for a community that I could call home, and to not shut myself off as he had done for so many years. The days he had left were short, but painful. After his death, I buried him next to our cabin, along with a small wooden goose. A symbol for prosperity in his afterlife.\nTaking his message to heart, I left my home. I have been travelling, and looking for a place to feel at peace, ever since. Unfortunately my race makes it difficult to fit into any community, being neither accepted completely by Elves nor humans.
