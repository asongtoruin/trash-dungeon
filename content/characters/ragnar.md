## Background
Raised as heir apparent of clan Firehammer, I spent most of my youth training.
Learning to fight, learning about the mines that gave us our wealth, learning 
the history of my clan, learning to be worthy of the name Firehammer. 

Then, suddenly, the relative peace of our region was shattered. On that fateful 
night, unable to sleep I had journeyed out towards the mines, to marvel at the
feats of dwarven engineering. Listening to the wind rushing through, I fell 
asleep. Maybe for a couple of hours, maybe longer. No matter, it was too long. 
I awoke to the smell of burning, and rushed back to find our stronghold aflame. 

An invasion of gnomes from the south seemed to cover every inch on the 
stronghold. I readied my axe, but hesitated. I saw my father dragged out into 
the courtyard and slaughtered. The murderer screamed... _find them all_. As I 
waited, hidden in the rocks, I heard the voice of Clangeddin for the first time. 
He told me that battle with certain defeat was futile but that honour must be 
restored. I knew then that I would need to be stronger to reclaim our land, and
I couldn't do it alone.
