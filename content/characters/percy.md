## Background
I have fought in countless battles and multiple wars. I was born to be a soldier and that is how I lived my life until I met my wife. She taught me gentler side of life and opened my eyes to what lay beyond the halls of war. I finally settled down and started a family until the Invaders of Rost came. 

I fought in the war in the Isles of Rost after losing my family to their invaders. I swore to fight for the defenceless and the weak and will stop at nothing to get revenge on those that took everything from me.

I am battle hardened, physically and mentally, which makes people keep their distance but I now know that I must make allies if I am to ever get the peace I so desperately crave.
