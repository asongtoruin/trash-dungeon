## Background
I was raised in a small and isolated community of few elves and humans. The scattered huts of my kin were based in a small glade between mountain and woodland. One cold winter day, Orcs came down from the mountain caves, in search for meat. The absence of flesh in the mountain had made them outraged with hunger. Being a very good treeclimber, I hid in the branches of an old pine tree while every last of my kin was murdered and every hut set aflame.

After making sure the Orcs had retired back into the mountain, I came down from the tree and wandered the forest. An old hermit, a human, called Sillifrey, found me while sourcing mushrooms in the woods. He had made for himself a small hut, well hidden whatever the season, between thick pines in the forest. Taking pity on me, he took me in and thought me all he knew.

Sillifrey used to be a lone hunter, selling his meat to the Dwarves of the mountains, before they were all chased out of their halls by murderous Orcs. I had never heard a word uttered on his kin or how he came to live in the forest by himself, and I did not ask for I did not want to seem impertinent as he had generously given me a home.

He educated me in the language of Dwarves, as well as the abundance that nature gives to us. Because of this he left me skilfull in sourcing food. I can track and hunt any woodland creature, and know my way well about the many berries and mushrooms that our forest gives us. I also know my way around many plants, and how to craft them into a trusty medicine or a deadly poison. Outsiders were to be avoided, so I was taught to be quiet while wandering, and to perceive my surroundings in great stillness.

There was also time for leisure. He thought me to whistle a fine tune, as well as carving small woodland animals from branches. During my travels I still enjoy these pasttimes near a roaring fire. And finally, he gifted me my common name, Yllwalyn. The name gifted to me by my kin remains private, a token of an unspoken past.

One day my mentor got infected by a mysterious disease, which turned his skin into black scabs and caused him great difficulty at breathing. On his deathbed he instructed me to search for a community that I could call home, and to not shut myself off as he had done for so many years. The days he had left were short, but painful. After his death, I buried him next to our cabin, along with a small wooden goose. A symbol for prosperity in his afterlife.

Taking his message to heart, I left my home. I have been travelling, and looking for a place to feel at peace, ever since. Unfortunately my race makes it difficult to fit into any community, being neither accepted completely by Elves nor humans. Nevertheless, I search for a band of likeminded people to call my family.
