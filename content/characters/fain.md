## Background
Born in the forests of XXXX to wood elf parents, I found myself in the city of 
XXXX as a child, completely alone. When visiting the city with my parents, we 
were set upon by bandits and in the chaos I saw my father killed and was then 
separated from my mother, I just kept on running. After reaching the city I 
heard talk of a massacre on the roads with no survivors, and was left with a 
thirst for vengeance. I have little of value with me but a family signet ring I 
was given by my parents, thatâ€™s got more sentimental value than monetary value. 
I was completely alone and spent a number of years as a young child roaming the 
streets of the city, stealing to live and sleeping rough or with gangs of other 
street children.

One day I was caught trying to steal from a monk, who decided to take me to his 
monastery. They often recruited from the urchins on the streets as few reputable 
people wanted to follow the way of the shadow. When I learnt what it was the 
monk intended, for me to learn the way of the shadow, I dedicated myself to the 
teachings in the hope that one day I could avenge my parentâ€™s deaths.

After a number of years training, performing assassinations for hire and other 
such tasks, I received an anonymous note tipping me off about the bandits who 
killed my parents and I left the monastery to go and hunt them - thatâ€™s where 
youâ€™ll find me now. I know that Iâ€™ll do whatever it takes to find them and bring 
them to whatever justice I see fit.
