## Background
I ran to the Coast 50 years ago, I live in a cave high above the tallest of waves. A deserted beach is my village. Miles from the nearest town. The Beach is often grey and overcast, a fierce wind blows. The Salty sea air has stuck to my long matted ginger locks. I am haunted by the things I have done in my last. I have seen and known evil, it was my friend, but that was long ago. I have befriended the local gulls and nesting birds that live in and around my cave home.
