## Context
- City is segregated by class / wealth
- Centre is fairly mixed, but generally people stay within their respective areas
- Look at the map
- Blacksmith near the pub is very famous
- Bridge near the docks is pretty massive
- Lots of military
- Outsiders generally are staying north-east - probably not going south of the river or to the noble area

## The session begins
- Waking up in the pub, all sat in roughly the same area on one of the very long tables in the pub
- Don't really remember details or faces, but broadly recognise faces
- Fain looks at the book in his hands and looks around at everyone else with faint recognition
- Rangar, feeling the pain in his nether regions, faintly recognises Hellebroe: "Gnome... what did you do?"
- Hellebore: "I didn't do nothing, get out of my way I am going to the bar for a whiskey"
- Ragnar: "You two, do I know you?"
- Yllwalyn: "I don't know. You seem familiar"
- Fain: "I'm not sure, I recognise you but I don't know why. Do you know anything about this book?" and holds up the book
- Dwarf at the bar (distantly): "YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO BE SERVED IN HERE, GNOME"
- The group head towards an empty table, the bards glance across and see a large human walking through the bar. They change their music to declare this is, indeed, the big show.
- Percivus sits at the table and tells the others to join him at the table. "I've been travelling alone for a while, it seems you might need my help. What say you?"'
- The group agrees
- Fain gets out his thieves tools to try and open the book
- After 10 minutes, he hears a click. After another 5, there is another click. The lock pops open.
- Fain reads the first page. There is a list of 10 names. The ink isn't black - it's **red**

  1. Zormenos
  2. _faded out_
  3. _faded out_
  4. _faded out_
  5. _faded out_
  6. _faded out_
  7. _faded out_
  8. Gryf Surefoot
  9. Volkas Gundrothu
  10. Norah Yama

- Fain recognises that Volkas is the proprietor of this tavern and Norah is the famous blacksmith.
- He shows this to everyone else and tells them who the two known people are
- Ragnar suggests that Percivous, as the clearest outsider, should ask the innkeeper who Zormenos is
- He does, and Volkas says "He is the leader of the arcane school - a very elusive man" but doesn't seem to say anything more
- Percivous tries to bribe him with silver, but Volkas instead pours a beer for each of them
- Volkas: "I don't really have any dealings with him, he's not seen around the city very often. I don't deal with him very often, I have no interest in the arcane"
- Percivous: "Do you think anything could harm Zormenos?"
- Volkas: "Hmmm. I don't think much as the leader of the school, though he is rather old so... maybe time"
- Hellebore shakes his glass at Percivous as he returns to the table, Percivous drops copper into it
- Ragnar roars with laughter
- Hellebore: "This is why I don't deal with other people"
- Fain: "There's something bigger at play here than your drink"
- Yllwalyn has already met the blacksmith, so she goes to the blacksmith's with Percivous to ask her who Gryf is
- As they leave, Fain turns to the next page of the book. The list continues, with fresh ink.

  11. Aethelwulf Broadoak
  12. Percivous Rigby
  13. Yllwalyn Finwion
  14. Ragnar Firehammer
  15. Fain Kruistammper

## At the blacksmith's
- Percivous and Yllwalyn see a large half-orc outside the blacksmith's
- Percivous introduces himself and asks where he can get his axe sharpened
- The half-orc introduces herself as Norah Yama. "There's a fair amount of damage on this, it might take a bit of time to fix it. It should be finished in the morning"
- Percivous: "I would like you to do it for me now, but as a former servant of the ROst army I would like to see some respect"
- Norah stands to her full height, a few inches taller than Percivous.
- Norah: "Well, I don't mind getting behind the forge but it will cost a little bit more. I'm not the type to deal with... standard weapons such as this. It will cost a gold piece, and I can have it done within half an hour"
- Percivous: "I'll pay you one gold if you will do my friend's dagger as well"
- Norah looks at Yllwalyn: "...does she want to give me the dagger then?"
- Norah takes the dagger, and gets to work
- Yllwalyn: "I'm sorry!". The half-orc's shoulders shake as she laughs.
- Percivous: "I'm new to this area. What's the safety of this town like, is it a well-kept town? Do people bother you?"
- Norah: "You'd be hard-pressed to find trouble at a shop full of weapons! There is trouble in every city, particularly in the southern district and somewhat in the east. It's a city with a lot of issues, but unless you're wearing gold you won't find much out and out danger"
- Yllwalyn: "And what about the school of arcane?"
- Norah: "Its presence in the capital gives it a lot of prestige, as does the sheer scale of the school. How long have you been in the city?"
- Percivous: "A couple of days."
- Yllwalyn: "...a while. I keep to myself though"
- Norah, looks at the dagger: "Makes sense"
- Percivous: "I've noticed a lot of looks due to my stature and military background. Is there anything I should keep an eye out for?"
- Norah: "People of this city are used to seeing a particular kind of uniform, and it's been a while since anyone from Rost has been to the city. They're probably more confused by your insignia rather than your race. The elite of the town keep to themselves, the barracks are designed to keep the city segregated. This area doesn't see too much attention from the elite or the guard, but if you go south of the river you'll see a lot more of that kind of presence."
- Percivous: "Look, I've seen your name on a list in a weird book and I think you might be in danger."
- Norah stops hammering. She puts her hammer down, as the weapons are finished, leaves them on the table and turns to walk away.
- The two follow her, picking up their weapons on the way. As she approaches a small building, which doesn't look like a blacksmith's (there's no chimney), she invites the two to enter the building with her.
- Norah, slamming her hand on the desk: "What book."
- Percivous: "Some travellers I met had it, they opened the book and it had your name in it in red ink"
- Norah sits back in her chair: "What are the other names?"
- They tell her about Volkas. Norah: "Was Gryf in the book?"
- They tell her he was
- Norah: "We used to be in a band of mercenaries, separate from the armies and cities. We fought against evil not for it. Although our adventuring days are over now, we offer what we can to the poor through charity. Let me ask you this - was the book in your posession before you went to the pub?"
- Yllwalyn: "No"
- Norah: "Do you remember how you got it?"
- Yllwalyn: "...no"
- Norah: "Many years ago, we came up against something we couldn't beat. It's not an easy task to undertake. If I was you, I would leave this book and try to erase it from your memories. Get on with your lives, move away, don't touch it. Are your names in the book?"
- Yllwalyn: "We've only seen the first page"
- Norah: "We had two other members of our party who are no longer with us. Gryf is the only one of us who still adventures, he doesn't come to the city much. Truth be told, I don't speak to Volkas very much. This changed us. Gryf is scarred by memories, sometimes he brings goods to the city but he never delivers them himself. The person who would know most is Volkas."
- The two leave. On the way back, Yllwalyn explains to Percivous that she is uncomfortable around orcs because they killed her family.

## Meanwhile, in the pub...
- Fain: "Why is this gnomne not in the book?"
- Ragnar slams his hammer on the table
- Hellebore: "Dwarf... I know as much as you about this damn book"
- Ragnar: "Who is Aethelwulf Broadoak?"
- Hellebore decides to shout the name across the bar. Nobody turns around.
- Hellebore: "Why don't you like me, dwarf?"
- Fain: "Maybe he just don't like you, and that's alright"
- Fain turns the further pages in the book, but there's nothing else there. The only pages with writing on are the first two.
- Ragnar goes to the bar to get a beer
- Volkas: "We have no beer. We were meant to get a new shipment, but our supplier is... inconsistent. Would you likw a whiskey instead"
- As Ragnar returns to the table, Percivous and Yllwalyn return to the pub

## Everyone is back together again
- Fain: "Before you tell us what you have learned, I have something to show you..."
- Fain shows them the book.
- Hellebore laughs and puts his feet on the table
- The moment his feet touch the table, a flustered-looking server comes and bats them off.
- Yllwalyn: "Why is my name in this book?"
- Fain: "Why don't we wait until closing time and try to speak to Volkas?"
- Volkas is standing on the central stage and he announces that the pub needs to close due to a lack of drink. People get up and start to leave.
- Fain: "That was lucky. Didn't have to get the gnome to fart"
- As Volkas walks past the table, Ragnar sticks his hammer out to block his path
- Volkas: "Can I help? Or can you get out"
- Percivous, standing up: "I think you should take a seat, mate"
- Volkas' brow furrows, and he pulls a stool over to the table
- Percivous explains their trip to see Norah, as Fain pushes the book across the table
- Volkas stands up, walks to a door behind the bar and invites the group to enter
- Volkas: "Sit"
- The group sits at a table with him
- Volkas, in a commanding voice: "Put that book away. How did you come across this?"
- Fain: "I don't know. We came into this pub separately, something happened and then I had this book"
- Volkas: "Give me the book"
- Fain: "I don't want to do that, some new names have appeared in it"
- Volkas slams his hammer into the desk, cracking it: "Give me the **book**"
- Fain obliges
- Volkas opens the book, looks through it, and then says "You need to leave this"
- Percivous: "My name is in it, I can't just leave it"
- Volkas sighs: "I take it all of your names are in the book?"
- Everyone looks at Hellebore, and he understands
- Volkas adds some detail to Norah's story, noting that their two companions who died were at 6 and 7 in the list. There was a 6th companion in their team, but his name was also not in the book. He stepped back from fighting the evil they faced, he didn't enter the room.
- Fain: "What does this mean for us. Are we... marked?"
- Volkas: "The last time I saw this book was many years ago, and Zormanos' name was already in it. To see our two companions not present but Gryf and Norah still in the list and alive... But you're telling me you don't know how you got in there? I remember the day we obtained the book. I can tell you that we did not win on that day, and that we chose to retreat after losing two people dear and close to us. I can also tell you that we fought our hardest, we all did as much as we could. The only person in the party who wasn't into the book never entered the room. Maybe, were Gryf here, he could help with the... memories. In fact, Gryf is the person were waiting on for the beer." 
- Fain: "So Gryf is missing?"
- Volkas: "Time doesn't work for Gryf as it does for other people - as a sailor, he operates on his own time. He remaind somewhat aloof, and the only reason I keep him as a supplier is our shared history."
- There is a knock on the door. One of the servers at the bar enters and says
> The shipment has arrived
