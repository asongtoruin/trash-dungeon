- All of the party are sitting in the pub
- Vision starts to fade and the world goes pitch black
- The party is no longer in the tavern!!
- Instead, the party finds themselves in a cylindrical room, no windows or doors, 6 torches lit and spaced evenly around the room. Lectern in the middle with an open book. Looks like bones at the base, and a cauldron that looks flaming-ish.
- Ragnar: "where have you brought me orc"
- Hellebore: "I have done nothing of the sort!"
- Fain - tries to hide, fails
- There's a rustling in the middle of the room!
- Yllwalyn heads towards the centre of the room to investigate. The light on the opposite wall goes out. Something is moving in the bones!
- It's a winged tailed bone devil! Hasn't noticed her yet.
- Hellebore and Ragnar stop fighting on seeing this - we'll settle this later! - and ready their weapons
- Fain tries to sneak around the edge of the room into the darkened area, but the bone demon notices him
- He dives in and punches it, but the form fades away and only a skeletal beetle-like being remains. 
- He punches again, bending over to strike the creature but again the form fades away and instead a humanoid skeletal form remains
- Hellebore runs in and tries to kick the creature, but his aim is bad and he misses
- Yllwalyn's sword cuts straight through the humanoid form - it feels as though contact is made but the form changes again.
- All that remains is a human, clad in dark embroidered robes but that seem splattered with blood
- Ragnar runs over and goes to hit the human with his hammer - it hits with a thud but rather than a caved chest the human's hand is blocking the strike, a few inches away from the hammer
- The party is thrown backwards - Yllwalyn and Hellebore are pushed to the floor, Fain and Ragnar keep their feet
- The human reaches up to the book on the lectern
- Fain grabs at the robe but loses traction.
- Ragnar grabs at the human's belt, but as the hammer falls from his grip it falls and strikes him in the crotch. He loses his grip on the belt as he recoils in pain.
- Fain uses this opportunity to leap above the human, to and over the lectern and grabs the book as he passes. As he turns and lands the other side of the lectern, the being disappears from the room. The book snaps shut and the other lights begin to fade out.
- Where there should be a keyhole to open the clasp on the book, Fain instead finds... nothing.
- Hellebore goes to look up around the lectern. There is nothing else on it, but it does not seem to be a permanent feature. 
- The room fades to black.
- Vision starts to brighten up and sound starts to increase - the party is back in the tavern... but we still have the book.
- The party can't really remember where they were before, but they feel like something had _happened..._
