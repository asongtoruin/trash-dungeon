[{"content":"Summary    Category Value     Class Paladin   Race Dwarf   Alignment Lawful Neutral   Deity Clangeddin Silverbeard    Pronouns He / him\nBackground Raised as heir apparent of clan Firehammer, I spent most of my youth training. Learning to fight, learning about the mines that gave us our wealth, learning the history of my clan, learning to be worthy of the name Firehammer.\nThen, suddenly, the relative peace of our region was shattered. On that fateful night, unable to sleep I had journeyed out towards the mines, to marvel at the feats of dwarven engineering. Listening to the wind rushing through, I fell asleep. Maybe for a couple of hours, maybe longer. No matter, it was too long. I awoke to the smell of burning, and rushed back to find our stronghold aflame.\nAn invasion of gnomes from the south seemed to cover every inch on the stronghold. I readied my axe, but hesitated. I saw my father dragged out into the courtyard and slaughtered. The murderer screamed\u0026hellip; find them all. As I waited, hidden in the rocks, I heard the voice of Clangeddin for the first time. He told me that battle with certain defeat was futile but that honour must be restored. I knew then that I would need to be stronger to reclaim our land, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t do it alone.\n","description":"A dwarf paladin","id":0,"section":"characters","tags":["player-character"],"title":"Ragnar Firehammer","uri":"http://trashdungeon.co.uk/characters/ragnar/"},{"content":"Summary    Category Value     Class Monk   Race Wood elf   Alignment True Neutral   Deity ????    Pronouns He / him\nBackground Born in the forests of XXXX to wood elf parents, I found myself in the city of XXXX as a child, completely alone. When visiting the city with my parents, we were set upon by bandits and in the chaos I saw my father killed and was then separated from my mother, I just kept on running. After reaching the city I heard talk of a massacre on the roads with no survivors, and was left with a thirst for vengeance. I have little of value with me but a family signet ring I was given by my parents, that’s got more sentimental value than monetary value. I was completely alone and spent a number of years as a young child roaming the streets of the city, stealing to live and sleeping rough or with gangs of other street children.\nOne day I was caught trying to steal from a monk, who decided to take me to his monastery. They often recruited from the urchins on the streets as few reputable people wanted to follow the way of the shadow. When I learnt what it was the monk intended, for me to learn the way of the shadow, I dedicated myself to the teachings in the hope that one day I could avenge my parent’s deaths.\nAfter a number of years training, performing assassinations for hire and other such tasks, I received an anonymous note tipping me off about the bandits who killed my parents and I left the monastery to go and hunt them - that’s where you’ll find me now. I know that I’ll do whatever it takes to find them and bring them to whatever justice I see fit.\n","description":"A wood elf monk","id":1,"section":"characters","tags":["player-character"],"title":"Fain Kruisstamper","uri":"http://trashdungeon.co.uk/characters/fain/"},{"content":"Summary    Category Value     Class Ranger   Race Half-elf   Alignment Chaotic good   Deity Mielikki, goddess of forests    Pronouns She / her\nBackground I was raised in a small and isolated community of few elves and humans. The scattered huts of my kin were based in a small glade between mountain and woodland. One cold winter day, Orcs came down from the mountain caves, in search for meat. The absence of flesh in the mountain had made them outraged with hunger. Being a very good treeclimber, I hid in the branches of an old pine tree while every last of my kin was murdered and every hut set aflame.\nAfter making sure the Orcs had retired back into the mountain, I came down from the tree and wandered the forest. An old hermit, a human, called Sillifrey, found me while sourcing mushrooms in the woods. He had made for himself a small hut, well hidden whatever the season, between thick pines in the forest. Taking pity on me, he took me in and thought me all he knew.\nSillifrey used to be a lone hunter, selling his meat to the Dwarves of the mountains, before they were all chased out of their halls by murderous Orcs. I had never heard a word uttered on his kin or how he came to live in the forest by himself, and I did not ask for I did not want to seem impertinent as he had generously given me a home.\nHe educated me in the language of Dwarves, as well as the abundance that nature gives to us. Because of this he left me skilfull in sourcing food. I can track and hunt any woodland creature, and know my way well about the many berries and mushrooms that our forest gives us. I also know my way around many plants, and how to craft them into a trusty medicine or a deadly poison. Outsiders were to be avoided, so I was taught to be quiet while wandering, and to perceive my surroundings in great stillness.\nThere was also time for leisure. He thought me to whistle a fine tune, as well as carving small woodland animals from branches. During my travels I still enjoy these pasttimes near a roaring fire. And finally, he gifted me my common name, Yllwalyn. The name gifted to me by my kin remains private, a token of an unspoken past.\nOne day my mentor got infected by a mysterious disease, which turned his skin into black scabs and caused him great difficulty at breathing. On his deathbed he instructed me to search for a community that I could call home, and to not shut myself off as he had done for so many years. The days he had left were short, but painful. After his death, I buried him next to our cabin, along with a small wooden goose. A symbol for prosperity in his afterlife.\nTaking his message to heart, I left my home. I have been travelling, and looking for a place to feel at peace, ever since. Unfortunately my race makes it difficult to fit into any community, being neither accepted completely by Elves nor humans. Nevertheless, I search for a band of likeminded people to call my family.\n","description":"A half-elf ranger","id":2,"section":"characters","tags":["player-character"],"title":"Yllwalyn","uri":"http://trashdungeon.co.uk/characters/yllwalyn/"},{"content":"Where all true adventures begin.\n","description":"","id":4,"section":"locations","tags":null,"title":"Stoke-on-Trent","uri":"http://trashdungeon.co.uk/locations/stoke-on-trent/"},{"content":"Session 0 was for initial set-up.
