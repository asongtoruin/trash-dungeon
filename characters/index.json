They change their music to declare this is, indeed, the big show.\n  Percivus sits at the table and tells the others to join him at the table. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been travelling alone for a while, it seems you might need my help. What say you?\u0026quot;'\n  The group agrees\n  Fain gets out his thieves tools to try and open the book\n  After 10 minutes, he hears a click. After another 5, there is another click. The lock pops open.\n  Fain reads the first page. There is a list of 10 names. The ink isn\u0026rsquo;t black - it\u0026rsquo;s red\n Zormenos faded out faded out faded out faded out faded out faded out Gryf Surefoot Volkas Gundrothu Norah Yama    Fain recognises that Volkas is the proprietor of this tavern and Norah is the famous blacksmith.\n  He shows this to everyone else and tells them who the two known people are\n  Ragnar suggests that Percivous, as the clearest outsider, should ask the innkeeper who Zormenos is\n  He does, and Volkas says \u0026ldquo;He is the leader of the arcane school - a very elusive man\u0026rdquo; but doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to say anything more\n  Percivous tries to bribe him with silver, but Volkas instead pours a beer for each of them\n  Volkas: \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t really have any dealings with him, he\u0026rsquo;s not seen around the city very often.

The list continues, with fresh ink.\nAethelwulf Broadoak Percivous Rigby Yllwalyn Finwion Ragnar Firehammer Fain Kruistammper    At the blacksmith\u0026rsquo;s  Percivous and Yllwalyn see a large half-orc outside the blacksmith\u0026rsquo;s Percivous introduces himself and asks where he can get his axe sharpened The half-orc introduces herself as Norah Yama. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a fair amount of damage on this, it might take a bit of time to fix it. It should be finished in the morning\u0026rdquo; Percivous: \u0026ldquo;I would like you to do it for me now, but as a former servant of the ROst army I would like to see some respect\u0026rdquo; Norah stands to her full height, a few inches taller than Percivous. Norah: \u0026ldquo;Well, I don\u0026rsquo;t mind getting behind the forge but it will cost a little bit more. I\u0026rsquo;m not the type to deal with\u0026hellip; standard weapons such as this. It will cost a gold piece, and I can have it done within half an hour\u0026rdquo; Percivous: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll pay you one gold if you will do my friend\u0026rsquo;s dagger as well\u0026rdquo; Norah looks at Yllwalyn: \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;does she want to give me the dagger then?\u0026rdquo; Norah takes the dagger, and gets to work Yllwalyn: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry!\u0026rdquo;. The half-orc\u0026rsquo;s shoulders shake as she laughs. Percivous: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m new to this area. What\u0026rsquo;s the safety of this town like, is it a well-kept town? Do people bother you?\u0026rdquo; Norah: \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;d be hard-pressed to find trouble at a shop full of weapons! There is trouble in every city, particularly in the southern district and somewhat in the east. It\u0026rsquo;s a city with a lot of issues, but unless you\u0026rsquo;re wearing gold you won\u0026rsquo;t find much out and out danger\u0026rdquo; Yllwalyn: \u0026ldquo;And what about the school of arcane?\u0026rdquo; Norah: \u0026ldquo;Its presence in the capital gives it a lot of prestige, as does the sheer scale of the school. How long have you been in the city?\u0026rdquo; Percivous: \u0026ldquo;A couple of days.\u0026rdquo; Yllwalyn: \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;a while. I keep to myself though\u0026rdquo; Norah, looks at the dagger: \u0026ldquo;Makes sense\u0026rdquo; Percivous: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed a lot of looks due to my stature and military background. Is there anything I should keep an eye out for?\u0026rdquo; Norah: \u0026ldquo;People of this city are used to seeing a particular kind of uniform, and it\u0026rsquo;s been a while since anyone from Rost has been to the city. They\u0026rsquo;re probably more confused by your insignia rather than your race. The elite of the town keep to themselves, the barracks are designed to keep the city segregated. This area doesn\u0026rsquo;t see too much attention from the elite or the guard, but if you go south of the river you\u0026rsquo;ll see a lot more of that kind of presence.\u0026rdquo; Percivous: \u0026ldquo;Look, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen your name on a list in a weird book and I think you might be in danger.\u0026rdquo; Norah stops hammering. She puts her hammer down, as the weapons are finished, leaves them on the table and turns to walk away. The two follow her, picking up their weapons on the way. As she approaches a small building, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like a blacksmith\u0026rsquo;s (there\u0026rsquo;s no chimney), she invites the two to enter the building with her. Norah, slamming her hand on the desk: \u0026ldquo;What book.\u0026rdquo; Percivous: \u0026ldquo;Some travellers I met had it, they opened the book and it had your name in it in red ink\u0026rdquo; Norah sits back in her chair: \u0026ldquo;What are the other names?\u0026rdquo; They tell her about Volkas. Norah: \u0026ldquo;Was Gryf in the book?\u0026rdquo; They tell her he was Norah: \u0026ldquo;We used to be in a band of mercenaries, separate from the armies and cities. We fought against evil not for it. Although our adventuring days are over now, we offer what we can to the poor through charity. Let me ask you this - was the book in your posession before you went to the pub?\u0026rdquo; Yllwalyn: \u0026ldquo;No\u0026rdquo; Norah: \u0026ldquo;Do you remember how you got it?\u0026rdquo; Yllwalyn: \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;no\u0026rdquo; Norah: \u0026ldquo;Many years ago, we came up against something we couldn\u0026rsquo;t beat. It\u0026rsquo;s not an easy task to undertake. If I was you, I would leave this book and try to erase it from your memories. Get on with your lives, move away, don\u0026rsquo;t touch it. Are your names in the book?\u0026rdquo; Yllwalyn: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve only seen the first page\u0026rdquo; Norah: \u0026ldquo;We had two other members of our party who are no longer with us. Gryf is the only one of us who still adventures, he doesn\u0026rsquo;t come to the city much. Truth be told, I don\u0026rsquo;t speak to Volkas very much. This changed us. Gryf is scarred by memories, sometimes he brings goods to the city but he never delivers them himself. The person who would know most is Volkas.\u0026rdquo; The two leave. On the way back, Yllwalyn explains to Percivous that she is uncomfortable around orcs because they killed her family.  Meanwhile, in the pub\u0026hellip;  Fain: \u0026ldquo;Why is this gnomne not in the book?\u0026rdquo; Ragnar slams his hammer on the table Hellebore: \u0026ldquo;Dwarf\u0026hellip; I know as much as you about this damn book\u0026rdquo; Ragnar: \u0026ldquo;Who is Aethelwulf Broadoak?\u0026rdquo; Hellebore decides to shout the name across the bar. Nobody turns around. Hellebore: \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t you like me, dwarf?\u0026rdquo; Fain: \u0026ldquo;Maybe he just don\u0026rsquo;t like you, and that\u0026rsquo;s alright\u0026rdquo; Fain turns the further pages in the book, but there\u0026rsquo;s nothing else there. The only pages with writing on are the first two. Ragnar goes to the bar to get a beer Volkas: \u0026ldquo;We have no beer. We were meant to get a new shipment, but our supplier is\u0026hellip; inconsistent. Would you likw a whiskey instead\u0026rdquo; As Ragnar returns to the table, Percivous and Yllwalyn return to the pub  Everyone is back together again  Fain: \u0026ldquo;Before you tell us what you have learned, I have something to show you\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Fain shows them the book. Hellebore laughs and puts his feet on the table The moment his feet touch the table, a flustered-looking server comes and bats them off. Yllwalyn: \u0026ldquo;Why is my name in this book?\u0026rdquo; Fain: \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t we wait until closing time and try to speak to Volkas?\u0026rdquo; Volkas is standing on the central stage and he announces that the pub needs to close due to a lack of drink. People get up and start to leave. Fain: \u0026ldquo;That was lucky. Didn\u0026rsquo;t have to get the gnome to fart\u0026rdquo; As Volkas walks past the table, Ragnar sticks his hammer out to block his path Volkas: \u0026ldquo;Can I help? Or can you get out\u0026rdquo; Percivous, standing up: \u0026ldquo;I think you should take a seat, mate\u0026rdquo; Volkas' brow furrows, and he pulls a stool over to the table Percivous explains their trip to see Norah, as Fain pushes the book across the table Volkas stands up, walks to a door behind the bar and invites the group to enter Volkas: \u0026ldquo;Sit\u0026rdquo; The group sits at a table with him Volkas, in a commanding voice: \u0026ldquo;Put that book away. How did you come across this?\u0026rdquo; Fain: \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know. We came into this pub separately, something happened and then I had this book\u0026rdquo; Volkas: \u0026ldquo;Give me the book\u0026rdquo; Fain: \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do that, some new names have appeared in it\u0026rdquo; Volkas slams his hammer into the desk, cracking it: \u0026ldquo;Give me the book\u0026rdquo; Fain obliges Volkas opens the book, looks through it, and then says \u0026ldquo;You need to leave this\u0026rdquo; Percivous: \u0026ldquo;My name is in it, I can\u0026rsquo;t just leave it\u0026rdquo; Volkas sighs: \u0026ldquo;I take it all of your names are in the book?\u0026rdquo; Everyone looks at Hellebore, and he understands Volkas adds some detail to Norah\u0026rsquo;s story, noting that their two companions who died were at 6 and 7 in the list. There was a 6th companion in their team, but his name was also not in the book. He stepped back from fighting the evil they faced, he didn\u0026rsquo;t enter the room. Fain: \u0026ldquo;What does this mean for us. Are we\u0026hellip; marked?\u0026rdquo; Volkas: \u0026ldquo;The last time I saw this book was many years ago, and Zormanos' name was already in it. To see our two companions not present but Gryf and Norah still in the list and alive\u0026hellip; But you\u0026rsquo;re telling me you don\u0026rsquo;t know how you got in there? I remember the day we obtained the book. I can tell you that we did not win on that day, and that we chose to retreat after losing two people dear and close to us. I can also tell you that we fought our hardest, we all did as much as we could. The only person in the party who wasn\u0026rsquo;t into the book never entered the room. Maybe, were Gryf here, he could help with the\u0026hellip; memories. In fact, Gryf is the person were waiting on for the beer.\u0026rdquo; Fain: \u0026ldquo;So Gryf is missing?\u0026rdquo; Volkas: \u0026ldquo;Time doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for Gryf as it does for other people - as a sailor, he operates on his own time. He remaind somewhat aloof, and the only reason I keep him as a supplier is our shared history.\u0026rdquo; There is a knock on the door. One of the servers at the bar enters and says   The shipment has arrived\n ","description":"Remember pubs? Remember being in pubs?

Instead, the party finds themselves in a cylindrical room, no windows or doors, 6 torches lit and spaced evenly around the room. Lectern in the middle with an open book. Looks like bones at the base, and a cauldron that looks flaming-ish. Ragnar: \u0026ldquo;where have you brought me gnome\u0026rdquo; Hellebore: \u0026ldquo;I have done nothing of the sort!\u0026rdquo; Fain - tries to hide, fails There\u0026rsquo;s a rustling in the middle of the room! Yllwalyn heads towards the centre of the room to investigate. The light on the opposite wall goes out. Something is moving in the bones! It\u0026rsquo;s a winged tailed bone devil! Hasn\u0026rsquo;t noticed her yet. Hellebore and Ragnar stop fighting on seeing this - we\u0026rsquo;ll settle this later! - and ready their weapons Fain tries to sneak around the edge of the room into the darkened area, but the bone demon notices him He dives in and punches it, but the form fades away and only a skeletal beetle-like being remains. He punches again, bending over to strike the creature but again the form fades away and instead a humanoid skeletal form remains Hellebore runs in and tries to kick the creature, but his aim is bad and he misses Yllwalyn\u0026rsquo;s sword cuts straight through the humanoid form - it feels as though contact is made but the form changes again. All that remains is a human, clad in dark embroidered robes but that seem splattered with blood Ragnar runs over and goes to hit the human with his hammer - it hits with a thud but rather than a caved chest the human\u0026rsquo;s hand is blocking the strike, a few inches away from the hammer The party is thrown backwards - Yllwalyn and Hellebore are pushed to the floor, Fain and Ragnar keep their feet The human reaches up to the book on the lectern Fain grabs at the robe but loses traction. Ragnar grabs at the human\u0026rsquo;s belt, but as the hammer falls from his grip it falls and strikes him in the crotch. He loses his grip on the belt as he recoils in pain. Fain uses this opportunity to leap above the human, to and over the lectern and grabs the book as he passes. As he turns and lands the other side of the lectern, the being disappears from the room. The book snaps shut and the other lights begin to fade out. Where there should be a keyhole to open the clasp on the book, Fain instead finds\u0026hellip; nothing. Hellebore goes to look up around the lectern. There is nothing else on it, but it does not seem to be a permanent feature. The room fades to black.

After reaching the city I heard talk of a massacre on the roads with no survivors, and was left with a thirst for vengeance.

The scattered huts of my kin were based in a small glade between mountain and woodland. One cold winter day, Orcs came down from the mountain caves, in search for meat. The absence of flesh in the mountain had made them outraged with hunger. Being a very good treeclimber, I hid in the branches of an old pine tree while every last of my kin was murdered and every hut set aflame.\nAfter making sure the Orcs had retired back into the mountain, I came down from the tree and wandered the forest. An old hermit, a human, called Sillifrey, found me while sourcing mushrooms in the woods. He had made for himself a small hut, well hidden whatever the season, between thick pines in the forest. Taking pity on me, he took me in and thought me all he knew.\nSillifrey used to be a lone hunter, selling his meat to the Dwarves of the mountains, before they were all chased out of their halls by murderous Orcs. I had never heard a word uttered on his kin or how he came to live in the forest by himself, and I did not ask for I did not want to seem impertinent as he had generously given me a home.\nHe educated me in the language of Dwarves, as well as the abundance that nature gives to us. Because of this he left me skilfull in sourcing food. I can track and hunt any woodland creature, and know my way well about the many berries and mushrooms that our forest gives us. I also know my way around many plants, and how to craft them into a trusty medicine or a deadly poison. Outsiders were to be avoided, so I was taught to be quiet while wandering, and to perceive my surroundings in great stillness.\nThere was also time for leisure. He thought me to whistle a fine tune, as well as carving small woodland animals from branches. During my travels I still enjoy these pasttimes near a roaring fire. And finally, he gifted me my common name, Yllwalyn. The name gifted to me by my kin remains private, a token of an unspoken past.\nOne day my mentor got infected by a mysterious disease, which turned his skin into black scabs and caused him great difficulty at breathing. On his deathbed he instructed me to search for a community that I could call home, and to not shut myself off as he had done for so many years. The days he had left were short, but painful. After his death, I buried him next to our cabin, along with a small wooden goose. A symbol for prosperity in his afterlife.\nTaking his message to heart, I left my home. I have been travelling, and looking for a place to feel at peace, ever since. Unfortunately my race makes it difficult to fit into any community, being neither accepted completely by Elves nor humans. Nevertheless, I search for a band of likeminded people to call my family.\n","description":"A half-elf ranger","id":6,"section":"characters","tags":["player-character"],"title":"Yllwalyn Finwion","uri":"http://trashdungeon.co.uk/characters/yllwalyn/"},{"content":"Where all true adventures begin.\n","description":"","id":8,"section":"locations","tags":null,"title":"Stoke-on-Trent","uri":"http://trashdungeon.co.uk/locations/stoke-on-trent/"},{"content":"Summary A MYSTERY CHARACTER!\nPronouns Description ","description":"","id":9,"section":"characters","tags":null,"title":"Lucinda","uri":"http://trashdungeon.co.uk/characters/lucinda/"}]
