Pronouns He / him\nBackground Raised as heir apparent of clan Firehammer, I spent most of my youth training.\nLearning to fight, learning about the mines that gave us our wealth, learning\nthe history of my clan, learning to be worthy of the name Firehammer.\nThen, suddenly, the relative peace of our region was shattered. On that fateful\nnight, unable to sleep I had journeyed out towards the mines, to marvel at the\nfeats of dwarven engineering. Listening to the wind rushing through, I fell\nasleep. Maybe for a couple of hours, maybe longer. No matter, it was too long.\nI awoke to the smell of burning, and rushed back to find our stronghold aflame.\nAn invasion of gnomes from the south seemed to cover every inch on the\nstronghold. I readied my axe, but hesitated. I saw my father dragged out into\nthe courtyard and slaughtered. The murderer screamed\u0026hellip; find them all. As I\nwaited, hidden in the rocks, I heard the voice of Clangeddin for the first time.\nHe told me that battle with certain defeat was futile but that honour must be\nrestored. I knew then that I would need to be stronger to reclaim our land, and\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t do it alone.\n","description":"A dwarf paladin","id":0,"section":"characters","tags":["player-character"],"title":"Ragnar Firehammer","uri":"http://trashdungeon.co.uk/characters/ragnar/"},{"content":"Summary    Category Value     Class Monk   Race Wood elf   Alignment True Neutral   Deity ????    Pronouns He / him\nBackground Born in the forests of XXXX to wood elf parents, I found myself in the city of\nXXXX as a child, completely alone. When visiting the city with my parents, we\nwere set upon by bandits and in the chaos I saw my father killed and was then\nseparated from my mother, I just kept on running. After reaching the city I\nheard talk of a massacre on the roads with no survivors, and was left with a\nthirst for vengeance. I have little of value with me but a family signet ring I\nwas given by my parents, that’s got more sentimental value than monetary value.\nI was completely alone and spent a number of years as a young child roaming the\nstreets of the city, stealing to live and sleeping rough or with gangs of other\nstreet children.\nOne day I was caught trying to steal from a monk, who decided to take me to his\nmonastery. They often recruited from the urchins on the streets as few reputable\npeople wanted to follow the way of the shadow. When I learnt what it was the\nmonk intended, for me to learn the way of the shadow, I dedicated myself to the\nteachings in the hope that one day I could avenge my parent’s deaths.\nAfter a number of years training, performing assassinations for hire and other\nsuch tasks, I received an anonymous note tipping me off about the bandits who\nkilled my parents and I left the monastery to go and hunt them - that’s where\nyou’ll find me now. I know that I’ll do whatever it takes to find them and bring\nthem to whatever justice I see fit.\n","description":"A wood elf monk","id":1,"section":"characters","tags":["player-character"],"title":"Fain Kruisstamper","uri":"http://trashdungeon.co.uk/characters/fain/"},{"content":"Summary    Category Value     Class Ranger   Race Half-elf   Alignment Chaotic good   Deity Mielikki, goddess of forests    Pronouns She / her\nBackground I was raised in a small and isolated community of few elves and humans. The\nscattered huts of my kin were based in a small glade between mountain and\nwoodland. One cold winter day, Orcs came down from the mountain caves, in search\nfor meat. The absence of flesh in the mountain had made them outraged with\nhunger. Being a very good treeclimber, I hid in the branches of an old pine tree\nwhile every last of my kin was murdered and every hut set aflame.\nAfter making sure the Orcs had retired back into the mountain, I came down from\nthe tree and wandered the forest. An old hermit, a human, called Sillifrey,\nfound me while sourcing mushrooms in the woods. He had made for himself a small\nhut, well hidden whatever the season, between thick pines in the forest. Taking\npity on me, he took me in and thought me all he knew.\nSillifrey used to be a lone hunter, selling his meat to the Dwarves of the\nmountains, before they were all chased out of their halls by murderous Orcs. I\nhad never heard a word uttered on his kin or how he came to live in the forest\nby himself, and I did not ask for I did not want to seem impertinent as he had\ngenerously given me a home.\nHe educated me in the language of Dwarves, as well as the abundance that nature\ngives to us. Because of this he left me skilfull in sourcing food. I can track\nand hunt any woodland creature, and know my way well about the many berries and\nmushrooms that our forest gives us. I also know my way around many plants, and\nhow to craft them into a trusty medicine or a deadly poison. Outsiders were to\nbe avoided, so I was taught to be quiet while wandering, and to perceive my\nsurroundings in great stillness.\nThere was also time for leisure. He thought me to whistle a fine tune, as well\nas carving small woodland animals from branches. During my travels I still enjoy\nthese pasttimes near a roaring fire. And finally, he gifted me my common name,\nYllwalyn. The name gifted to me by my kin remains private, a token of an\nunspoken past.\nOne day my mentor got infected by a mysterious disease, which turned his skin\ninto black scabs and caused him great difficulty at breathing. On his deathbed\nhe instructed me to search for a community that I could call home, and to not\nshut myself off as he had done for so many years. The days he had left were\nshort, but painful. After his death, I buried him next to our cabin, along with\na small wooden goose. A symbol for prosperity in his afterlife.\nTaking his message to heart, I left my home. I have been travelling, and\nlooking for a place to feel at peace, ever since. Unfortunately my race makes\nit difficult to fit into any community, being neither accepted completely by\nElves nor humans. Nevertheless, I search for a band of likeminded people to\ncall my family.\n","description":"A half-elf ranger","id":2,"section":"characters","tags":["player-character"],"title":"Yllwalyn","uri":"http://trashdungeon.co.uk/characters/yllwalyn/"},{"content":"Where all true adventures begin.\n","description":"","id":4,"section":"locations","tags":null,"title":"Stoke-on-Trent","uri":"http://trashdungeon.co.uk/locations/stoke-on-trent/"},{"content":"Session 0 was for initial set-up.
