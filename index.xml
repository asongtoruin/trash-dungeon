        <description>All of the party are sitting in the pub Vision starts to fade and the world goes pitch black The party is no longer in the tavern!! Instead, the party finds themselves in a cylindrical room, no windows or doors, 6 torches lit and spaced evenly around the room. Lectern in the middle with an open book. Looks like bones at the base, and a cauldron that looks flaming-ish. Ragnar: &amp;ldquo;where have you brought me gnome&amp;rdquo; Hellebore: &amp;ldquo;I have done nothing of the sort!</description>
