        <description>The group are in Volkas&#39; office. Door swings open, and the server says the shipment has arrived, and there aren&amp;rsquo;t enough people to bring the shipment back to the tavern. Percivous throws his chair back, storms off through the door: &amp;ldquo;I need to sort something out. I won&amp;rsquo;t be long&amp;rdquo; Volkas has a heated discussion with the member of staff. Lots of the tavern&amp;rsquo;s staff have taken the opportunity to leave.</description>
