        <description>CHRISTMAS SPECIAL It&amp;rsquo;s Father Baktos Claus!!!
We begin at the docks&amp;hellip;  All of a sudden, time and reality pauses. Everything on the docks comes to a crashing halt and nobody else is moving except the 5 members of the party Loud voice - &amp;ldquo;I AM BAKTOS. I AM SEEKING THE GREATEST MEAL IN THE UNIVERSE. YOU FIVE HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO COOK ME&amp;hellip; A GOOD FUCKING MEAL&amp;rdquo; Sudden clap and disappear Lightly glowing reddish walls either side of us, and a pathway leading ahead At the end is a wooden door, slightly ajar, about 30 feet away The party heads through the door and is greeted by a huge room - 120 feet and circular Four doors going off it - two either side of the door we entered through, and two further around the perimeter Looks like a gladiatiorial coliseum, with a roof on it All around the area is tonnes of kitchenware - stoves, pots, basic spices etc.</description>

        <description>The group are in Volkas&#39; office. Door swings open, and the server says the shipment has arrived, and there aren&amp;rsquo;t enough people to bring the shipment back to the tavern. Percivous throws his chair back, storms off through the door: &amp;ldquo;I need to sort something out. I won&amp;rsquo;t be long&amp;rdquo; Volkas has a heated discussion with the member of staff. Lots of the tavern&amp;rsquo;s staff have taken the opportunity to leave.</description>

        <description>Context  City is segregated by class / wealth Centre is fairly mixed, but generally people stay within their respective areas Look at the map Blacksmith near the pub is very famous Bridge near the docks is pretty massive Lots of military Outsiders generally are staying north-east - probably not going south of the river or to the noble area  The session begins   Waking up in the pub, all sat in roughly the same area on one of the very long tables in the pub</description>

        <description>All of the party are sitting in the pub Vision starts to fade and the world goes pitch black The party is no longer in the tavern!! Instead, the party finds themselves in a cylindrical room, no windows or doors, 6 torches lit and spaced evenly around the room. Lectern in the middle with an open book. Looks like bones at the base, and a cauldron that looks flaming-ish. Ragnar: &amp;ldquo;where have you brought me gnome&amp;rdquo; Hellebore: &amp;ldquo;I have done nothing of the sort!</description>
