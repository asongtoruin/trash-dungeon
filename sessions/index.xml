        <description>Context  City is segregated by class / wealth Centre is fairly mixed, but generally people stay within their respective areas Look at the map Blacksmith near the pub is very famous Bridge near the docks is pretty massive Lots of military Outsiders generally are staying north-east - probably not going south of the river or to the noble area  The session begins   Waking up in the pub, all sat in roughly the same area on one of the very long tables in the pub</description>

        <description>All of the party are sitting in the pub Vision starts to fade and the world goes pitch black The party is no longer in the tavern!! Instead, the party finds themselves in a cylindrical room, no windows or doors, 6 torches lit and spaced evenly around the room. Lectern in the middle with an open book. Looks like bones at the base, and a cauldron that looks flaming-ish. Ragnar: &amp;ldquo;where have you brought me gnome&amp;rdquo; Hellebore: &amp;ldquo;I have done nothing of the sort!</description>
